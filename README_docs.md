# Project Title: Query and Answer Rewriting

This project provides a framework for rewriting user queries to improve search relevance and generating concise answers based on the rewritten queries. It aims to bridge the gap between user intent and the underlying data representation.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two primary modules: `query_rewrite.py` and `answer_generator.py`. `query_rewrite.py` focuses on transforming the original user query into a more effective search query. `answer_generator.py` then uses this rewritten query to extract and synthesize relevant information, forming a concise answer.

## File-by-File Deep Dive

### `answer_generator.py`

*   **Role:** This file is responsible for taking a rewritten query as input and generating a concise answer. It likely interacts with a data source (not explicitly defined here) to retrieve and process information relevant to the rewritten query.
*   **Key Classes/Functions:** While specific classes and functions are not provided, we can infer that this file likely contains functions for:
    *   `generate_answer(rewritten_query)`: This function is the core of the module, responsible for taking the rewritten query, retrieving the appropriate data, and generating a human-readable answer. It likely orchestrates the data retrieval and answer synthesis processes.
    *   Potentially, functions to connect to the datasource and format results into a presentable answer.
*   **Language:** Python
*   **Notable Patterns:** Data retrieval, information synthesis, and natural language generation might be used.

### `query_rewrite.py`

*   **Role:** This file handles the task of rewriting the initial user query to improve search relevance and accuracy. This process likely involves techniques such as stemming, synonym expansion, or query intent recognition.
*   **Key Classes/Functions:** While specific classes and functions are not provided, we can infer that this file likely contains functions for:
    *   `rewrite_query(original_query)`: This function accepts the initial user query and applies a series of transformations to produce a rewritten query that is better suited for information retrieval.
    *   Potentially, functions for parsing the original query, identifying key terms, and applying specific rewriting rules.
*   **Language:** Python
*   **Notable Patterns:** Natural language processing techniques like stemming, lemmatization, synonym expansion, or query classification are likely employed. Rule-based or machine learning models might be used for query rewriting.

### `__pycache__` Directory

This directory contains compiled bytecode files (`.pyc` files) generated by the Python interpreter. These files are automatically created when Python source code is executed and serve as a cache to speed up subsequent executions of the same code. The specific files listed are cached versions of `answer_generator.py` and `query_rewrite.py`.

## Cross-File Relationships

The `query_rewrite.py` module produces a rewritten query, which is then consumed by the `answer_generator.py` module.  Specifically, the `rewrite_query` function in `query_rewrite.py` produces output that is used as input to the `generate_answer` function in `answer_generator.py`.  The rewritten query acts as the communication bridge between these two modules.

## Getting Started

Due to the limited information about the entry point and dependencies, specific CLI commands cannot be provided. However, the general workflow would involve:

1.  **Ensure Python is installed:** This project is written in Python, so ensure you have a compatible version installed (Python 3.6 or higher is recommended).
2.  **Install dependencies:** Any dependencies required by the modules need to be installed using `pip`.  (Example: `pip install <dependency_name>`).  The dependency list isn't available from this project summary.
3.  **Run the modules:** Example of how to call the functions (assuming entry points):

    ```bash
    # Example usage (assuming main functions or scripts)
    python query_rewrite.py "original query"
    python answer_generator.py "rewritten query" # or using the output from query_rewrite.py
    ```

    A more practical way would be to have a main driver script.

## Output Examples

Given the project structure, we can infer the following potential outputs:

*   **`query_rewrite.py`:**  The primary output of this module is the rewritten query string.  This string could be printed to the console or used as input to another process.
*   **`answer_generator.py`:** This module generates a concise answer based on the rewritten query. This answer could be a string, a formatted document, or a data structure suitable for display or further processing.

The actual format and content of the outputs would depend on the specific implementation details of the modules.
