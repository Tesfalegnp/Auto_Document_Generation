# Project Title: Galaxy Tool Explorer Documentation Generator

This project analyzes a Galaxy tool ecosystem and generates documentation to understand its structure and components. It includes functionality to parse, explore, and summarize Galaxy tool configurations, data structures, and dependencies, creating outputs useful for developers and administrators.

## Project Structure

The project operates in a data-driven manner. `main.py` serves as the entry point. It orchestrates the analysis of the `galaxy_tool_explorer` directory, which contains Galaxy-related data and configuration files. `explorer.py` handles the core logic for exploring and summarizing this data. The project interacts with and documents various file types and utilizes `schemas.py` for data representation.

## File-by-File Deep Dive

### `main.py`

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Role:** Entry point of the application. It drives the entire documentation generation process.
*   **Key Functions:**
    *   `main()`: The main function that executes the program. It likely instantiates the `explorer.py` functionality and processes the `galaxy_tool_explorer` directory.
*   **Cross-File Relationships:**
    *   Instantiates and utilizes the `explorer.py` module.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/explorer.py`

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Role:** Contains the core logic for exploring and summarizing the Galaxy tool ecosystem.
*   **Key Classes/Functions:**
    *   `Explorer`: Likely a central class to manage the exploration of the Galaxy directory. Contains methods to parse configuration files, analyze data structures, and generate summaries. The specifics of the class depend on implementation, but this is a likely abstraction.
*   **Cross-File Relationships:**
    *   Called and utilized by `main.py`.
    *   Potentially utilizes `models/schemas.py` to represent data.

### `models/schemas.py`

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Role:** Defines data schemas using a library like `pydantic` or `dataclasses`. These schemas specify the structure of the data representing Galaxy tools, configurations, and dependencies.
*   **Key Classes/Functions:**
    *   Likely contains classes like `Tool`, `Configuration`, `Dependency`, etc., defining the attributes and types for each entity.
*   **Cross-File Relationships:**
    *   Used by `explorer.py` to define the structure of the analyzed Galaxy data.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/data/config/integrated_tool_panel.xml`

*   **Language:** XML (Extensible Markup Language)
*   **Role:** A Galaxy tool panel configuration file. It likely defines the structure and contents of the tool panel within a Galaxy instance.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/data/control.sqlite`

*   **Language:** SQLite Database
*   **Role:** A SQLite database file.  Potentially stores metadata related to Galaxy tools, workflows, or other Galaxy-related information.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/data/dependencies/involucro`

*   **Language:** Unknown
*   **Role:** Likely contains dependency information for Galaxy tools.  The specific format is unknown but could be a text file or a specific dependency management format.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/data/objects/000/dataset_1.dat`

*   **Language:** Unknown
*   **Role:** A data file potentially used within the Galaxy ecosystem. The `.dat` extension suggests it contains raw data or a specific data format relevant to Galaxy tools.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/data/tool_search_index/default/_MAIN_0.toc`

*   **Language:** Unknown
*   **Role:** A table of contents (`.toc`) file for the default tool search index. Likely part of the indexing mechanism used by Galaxy to search for available tools.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/data/tool_search_index/ontology:edam_operations/_MAIN_0.toc`

*   **Language:** Unknown
*   **Role:** A table of contents file for a tool search index categorized by "edam_operations" ontology.  EDAM is a standard ontology for describing operations in bioinformatics.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/data/tool_search_index/ontology:edam_topics/_MAIN_0.toc`

*   **Language:** Unknown
*   **Role:** A table of contents file for a tool search index categorized by "edam_topics" ontology.  EDAM is a standard ontology for describing topics in bioinformatics.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/data/universe.sqlite`

*   **Language:** SQLite Database
*   **Role:** A SQLite database likely containing core data for the Galaxy universe, such as users, workflows, or datasets.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/galaxy.yml`

*   **Language:** YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
*   **Role:** Configuration file defining various aspects of the galaxy tool explorer, e.g. location of data files and settings.

### `galaxy_tool_explorer/input.txt`

*   **Language:** Text
*   **Role:** Generic data or configuration file. May contain input parameters for the Galaxy tools or other relevant data.

### `test.js`

*   **Language:** Javascript
*   **Role:** Test file for testing purposes.

### `test.metta`

*   **Language:** Metta
*   **Role:** Test file for testing purposes.

### `sample_java.java`

*   **Language:** Java
*   **Role:** Example Java file. Possibly used by Galaxy tools.

## Getting Started

To run the AST generator and README generator (if implemented), execute the following commands:

```bash
# Run the Galaxy Tool Explorer
python main.py
```

## Output Examples

The tool will likely generate the following files:

*   `ast_summary.json`: A JSON file summarizing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the analyzed code.
*   `data_summary.json`: A JSON file summarizing the extracted data from the Galaxy configuration files and data structures.
*   `dependencies.txt`: A text file listing the dependencies of the analyzed Galaxy tools.
*   `tool_panel_structure.txt`: A text file describing the tool panel structure.
